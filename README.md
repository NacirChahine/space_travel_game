# Spaceship Game ðŸš€

A simple 2D spaceship game built with Python and Pygame. The player controls a spaceship to avoid falling asteroids, progressing through increasingly challenging levels. Each level increases the speed and number of asteroids.

## Features
- Multiple Asteroids: As the player progresses, the number of asteroids increases, adding to the challenge.
- Lives System: The player starts with 3 lives. Colliding with an asteroid reduces lives. The game ends when all lives are lost.
- Improved Graphics: The spaceship, asteroids, and power-ups have better shapes and visuals. (More graphical updates can be added later.)
- Pause and Resume: Press P to pause the game and see a "Game Paused" screen. Press P again to resume.
- Levels increase as you score points, making the game harder.
- Power-ups give temporary advantages like additional lives or extra speed.
- Reach a score of 50 to win the game and display the "You Win!" screen.
