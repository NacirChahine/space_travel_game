A simple 2D spaceship game built with Python and Pygame. The player controls a spaceship to avoid falling asteroids, progressing through increasingly challenging levels. Each level increases the speed and number of asteroids.

## Features
- Multiple Asteroids: As the player progresses, the number of asteroids increases, adding to the challenge.
