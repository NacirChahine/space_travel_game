# space_travel_game
A simple 2D spaceship game built with Python and Pygame. Control a spaceship to avoid falling asteroids while progressing through increasingly difficult levels. Each level increases asteroid speed and spawns more asteroids. Great for learning basic game development concepts using Pygame.
